# Telecom Company Customer Classification - Stayed or Churned.

## Introduction

This project focuses on classifying customer churn in a telecommunications company based in California during the second quarter of 2022. The dataset comprises 7,043 customer records, each containing information about demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, and the status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned).

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers likely to churn. By doing so, the telecommunications company can proactively take measures to retain these customers and mitigate revenue loss.

## Data

The data used in this project contains information about 7,043 customers of a telecommunications company in California in the second quarter of 2022. Each record represents a customer and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more!

## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for model training.
3. **Model Development**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification and train the model using the preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained model using relevant evaluation metrics.
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model for real-time prediction of customer churn.
